# We-Are-Oulu
In this project, we would like to describe real stories of international students, staff, or any person related to higher education regarding their challenges during their lives or studies at the University of Oulu in a virtual reality environment. Therefore, others who are primarily Finnish people would be aware of these challenges while experiencing our work.
