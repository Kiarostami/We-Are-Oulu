# We-Are-Finland
In this project, we would like to describe real stories of international students, staff, or any person related to higher education regarding their challenges during their lives or studies at the University of Oulu in a virtual reality environment. Therefore, others who are primarily Finnish people would be aware of these challenges while experiencing our work. To achieve our purpose, we designed an experiment with three main stages: Data Collection, Pre-experiment questionnaire, and Post-experiment questionnaire with a structured interview.  In the first step, we collect data from foreigner related persons to higher education at the university. Then, the second and third steps would be held as an experiment. Participants would listen to the first-step participants' stories and interact with their avatars in a VR environment. In the end, we would measure the empathy in our participants with the Pre-experiment and Post-experiment questionnaires.
